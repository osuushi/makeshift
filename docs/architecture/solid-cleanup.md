## Standalone cleanup only (founder decision, 2026-10-04)

[Issue #11 decision](https://github.com/osuushi/makeshift/issues/11#issuecomment-5980233999):
Clean up is an explicit standalone tool. Modeling operation controls, including
Extrude, Revolve, Boolean, Fillet/Chamfer and face offset, offer ordinary acceptance
and cancellation; they never offer cleanup on completion or schedule availability
probes. Ordinary completion preserves the operation's subdivisions.

Cleanup stays within each body. Joining touching bodies is a separate Union.
Offset's established contact-absorption behavior still merges the contacted faces;
an ordinary offset without absorption does not refine the whole body.

**Clean up selection** previews selected body topology, explicitly selected edges,
and edges incident to selected faces. Unselected face boundaries are protected;
redundant neighboring edge breakpoints at eligible endpoints may also disappear.
Kernel-only periodic seams can reconnect as cylindrical walls merge.
During Cleanup, an edge between faces with different active decorator instance
IDs is protected even when that edge or the whole body is selected. An undecorated
face cannot merge into a decorated face; distinct instances cannot merge even if
settings match. Faces of one instance and undecorated neighbors within their own
regions remain eligible. Unresolved attachments reserve no active face membership.

The native kernel unifies coincident supporting surfaces/curves without approximate
surface fitting or spline concatenation. It validates the solid and volume, returns
face/edge correspondence, and retains body identity. DocumentOwner alone accepts
geometry and owns Undo. Explicit cleanup is a separate step from the preceding
operation; Cancel leaves accepted geometry and selection intact. An unchanged
cleanup result adds no geometry history.

## Compatibility

Existing native/script request flags for acceptance with cleanup and read-only
cleanup checks remain supported. Their operation-local scope covers newly created
or changed faces/edges plus surviving edges of consumed faces, without spreading
through older subdivisions. Decorator boundaries remain protected. These compatible
requests do not expose a modeling completion control or trigger an automatic UI
probe; standalone cleanup is the ordinary application interaction.
